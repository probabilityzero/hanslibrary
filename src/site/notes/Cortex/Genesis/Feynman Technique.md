# Feynman Technique

The Feynman Technique is a method where you teach a concept to someone else to learn something. First, you write down what you know about a topic, as if explaining it to a friend or student. This often reveals gaps in your knowledge, much like trying to navigate a new city without a map—you think you know the way, but soon realize you’re lost in unfamiliar territory. 

I learnt about this way much before being familiar with him, from a [[Learn Al Quran Academy\|workshop in my boarding school]] as, "[[Learn, Pair, Share\|Learn, Pair, Share]]". But long before, I used to teach maths, physics to few of my schoolmates who later became my friends; sometimes they would find it too detailed but that was me trying to understand... Or revise it myself, while giving them whole idea.

The technique is also about going back to notes/book when you find gap in your knowledge, filled in those gaps, and then returned to explanation, making it simpler and more relatable. Use analogies if possible. Continue to refine your understanding and explanation. Teaching it out loud to yourself even. That's how you learn... by teaching.

> Today, you looked in the mirror,
> And you felt sad; you were alone.
> The light whispered, the air sang,
> But your beloved did not return.
> 
> The days remorse you,
> The nights blame you,
> And anguish weighs upon you.
> 
> This melancholic melody of living,
> It hums; and it haunts you.
> Despair grips your being,
> Desperate, where are you going?
> 
> You will smile; you'll pray to the gods,
> You will tremble your hands, 
> But your beloved will not return,
> Your beloved, so beloved.

2. For tools, create a **centralized database** with tags or metadata fields:  
   - Example: Excel is tagged under **Business Analysis**, **Financial Analysis**, and **Data Science**.  
   - Example: Python is tagged under **Data Engineering**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Analysis**.  

3. Use **linked notes** for overlapping areas:  
   - Example: A note on **Python** can link to both **Data Science Research** (Engineering) and **Data Analysis** (Analysis).  

4. Prioritize topics based on current focus:  
   - Start with Excel, Python, Tableau, and Financial Analysis for immediate learning.  
   - Add research-heavy topics like ML and cloud as you move toward deeper engineering goals.

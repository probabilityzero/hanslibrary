# Quest Logs

---
- Revision progress for Financial Accounting was slower than expected, need to focus on tricky problems tomorrow.
- Business Communication case studies seem straightforward now, but reviewing them again before the exam will help.
- Group discussions on Business Environment helped clarify a few concepts I was struggling with.  
- Tried a mock exam for Business Economics, results were decent, but time management could improve.
